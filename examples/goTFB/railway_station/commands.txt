This file controls the railway_station input SIFBs, as detailed below. The associated events will only be emitted on *change* of the characters,
i.e. changing the first character to an 'o' will cause the InternetCtrl SIFB to emit OP_DOOR_OPEN exactly once.

The file's first six characters are examined to give the current Train Detections
-: no detection 
p: detection
chars:
1: Dwi

2: Rn 
3: Rs 

Then there is a space

The file's next character is examined to give status of So Signal
r: red
g: green
